# Control-Systems
## Description
This repo contains pre-lab and after-lab reports along with Matlab codes for the 4 labs we implemented during the course of Control Systems.

### Introductory Lab

Objective: This lab involves recording system parameters (like rise time and overshoot) using Cassylab software, and performing initial conditions discharge procedures before measurements.

### Lab 1

Objective: This lab focuses on the response of closed-loop systems with or without a PID controller, using methods like ZN or CHR. The tasks include calculating transfer functions, system parameters (rise time, overshoot, etc.), comparing open and closed-loop responses, and evaluating the effectiveness of different controllers and tuning methods.

### Lab 2 (Motor-Generator)

Objective: This lab involves using a motor-generator set to study the control of a DC motor's speed and a DC generator's output voltage. It covers the theoretical background of electric motors and generators, the experimental setup, and the procedures for conducting experiments on speed and voltage control using PID controllers. The lab also includes instructions on how to analyze the experimental data and evaluate the results.

### Lab 3 (Temperature)

Objective: The goal of this lab is to understand the impact of temperature on various parameters, likely related to material properties or system behaviors, through experimental measurements and analysis.
